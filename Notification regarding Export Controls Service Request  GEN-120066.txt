EXPORT CONTROL DETERMINATION NUMBER: COPY-2024-120066

April 9, 2024

By submitting the attached Opens Source Copyright information, Export Control understands that 
author(s) and sponsor concur with the request and that the copyright materials do not include security 
controlled data. The software does not appear to be specifically designed, developed, configured, 
adapted, or modified for a military, missile, satellite, or other controlled use listed on the USML. Based 
upon the information provided the software does not include encryption,  crypto-analytic functions or 
support prohibitions under 15 CFR 744.  The software  does not appear to require additional DOE non-
proliferation review nor does this software require notification to the Department of Commerce due to 
encryption or other controls.  The software and associated documentation is intended for release as 
Open Source Software (OSS).  The publication of the software under a OSS license does not require an 
export control license.

Export Control has made the following export control determination on a request to review Open Source 
Review Requested - ID: 81951603 –  systemd Snapshot Technology/Item Classification
Based on available information provided and/or in discussions with the cited parties, the Open Source 
Review Requested - ID: 81951603 --   systemd Snapshot meets the following definition for fundamental 
research:  

“Research in science, engineering or mathematics, the results of which ordinarily are published and 
shared broadly within the research community, and for which the researchers have not accepted 
restrictions on publication for proprietary or national security reasons.” 

Therefore, the research output does not fall under export control jurisdiction and is releasable without 
restriction.

Problem that was solved:
More embedded systems are using Linux as their operating system foundation. In some cases, the more 
modern systemd initialization system is being used. Systemd comes with many tools to understand the 
many files that define how the system's services start; however, the system must be RUNNING in order 
to use them since many of the artifacts are maintained in memory. When security analysis is performed 
on an embedded system, the analyst may not be able to operate the system firmware, or if the system 
can be run, the aforementioned systemd tools are not readily available. These analysis constraints place 
the burden of discerning how the firmware initializes, which parameters critical services use, and the 
order in which services are started on the analyst without purpose-built tools for the job. Our systemd 
snapshot capability seeks to mitigate these barriers to analysis by enabling an analyst to collect, 
understand and consolidate systemd startup details in a more efficient manner when only the firmware 
image is available and it cannot be easily run. Having such information makes performing security 
assessments on embedded systems easier.

Solution provided by the computer code:
Systemd Snapshot crawls a Linux filesystem according to the systemd specification since parsing order is 
important. It parses the many files that define a system's startup semantics and consolidates them into 
data structures for manipulation and summarization into other forms. The key point is the system itself 
does not need to start, the file system remains a static image. So, we perform analysis on a machine of 
our choosing instead of relying on performing analysis using the same system that is relying on systemd 
to initialize. Systemd snapshot also seeks to understand which information actually defines system 
initialization and which information is not used (e.g., some information may be overridden and some 
may just be mistakenly ignored) -- lets call these initialization semantics. In other words, the tool aims to 
aggregate data and re-create the information that resides in memory on a running system. An additional 
feature that we provide is automatic collection of binary library dependencies and collection and 
association of human-readable strings. This information is not necessary for a RUNNING system, but is 
extremely valuable for system analysis and security assessment. We provide summarization in file 
formats and translation into a graph that can be visualized in third-party tools. Additionally, this 
capability can perform targeted analysis on specific subsequences of the initialization process. Since 
these systems can be extremely complex and incorporate MANY services that work together, it is 
sometimes important to focus the analysis on a particular subset of services a system requires while 
ignoring others. Finally, this capability can modify a systemd initialization system in order to better 
facilitate emulation of a system when the hardware is not available and more targeted introspection is 
necessary.

Computer code’s functionality:
- aggregate all data from systemd initialization system
- compare data and startups between two systemd systems or between versions of the same system
- obtain file forensics information on binaries called during startup
- provide explicit mapping of implicit dependencies of systemd unit files
- show startup relationships between unit files visually through a graph or via JSON output
- perform targeted analysis on subsets of unit file dependencies
- modify systemd initialization system to better facilitate emulation of a system

Advantages / Benefits:
Based on our research no tools exist that perform this capability WITHOUT actually running the firmware 
that makes use of Systemd. The capability can make assessment of a system much easier since it 
consolidates the information contained in many files into a single location. In short, we consolidate and 
associate Linux system elements and repackage them in more understandable forms.
